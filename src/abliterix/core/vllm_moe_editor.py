"""In-place MoE router weight suppression for vLLM-loaded models.

This module bridges the gap between abliterix's HF-path ``_apply_moe_steering``
(which scales down router gate weights for top-N safety experts) and the vLLM
backend where the model is sharded across tensor-parallel workers.

We use ``LLM.llm_engine.collective_rpc`` (vLLM v0.8+, PR #12151) to dispatch
a worker-side callable that locates each layer's router module and scales the
rows corresponding to safety experts in place. Since the router
(``ReplicatedLinear`` for gpt-oss, ``Linear`` for Qwen3 MoE / Mixtral) is
fully replicated on every TP rank, identical edits on every rank keep the
replicated weights coherent without any cross-rank coordination.

Backup-and-restore semantics:

* First ``apply(...)`` call on a given ``(layer, expert)`` pair snapshots the
  original weight row into the worker's ``_abliterix_router_backup`` dict.
* Subsequent ``apply(...)`` calls (new trial) compute the new scaled weight
  from the backup (not the currently-modified weight), so suppression never
  compounds across trials.
* ``restore()`` writes the backup back into every touched row.

MXFP4 / quantization note: router weights are NOT in the MoE expert quant
block. They live in ``modules_to_not_convert`` for gpt-oss (see its
``config.json``) and are stored as BF16. This is why router suppression is
safe to apply on a native MXFP4 model without any dequant step — only the
fused expert weights (``w13_weight``, ``w2_weight``) are packed.

    Why "once": PyTorch's Dynamo / ``@support_torch_compile`` decorator on
    ``Qwen3MoeModel`` / ``GptOssModel`` silently skips forward hooks that
    were registered AFTER the first forward triggered compilation
    (pytorch/pytorch#117758). Re-registering hooks per trial therefore
    produces no effect on KL — this was the root cause of the
    gpt-oss-120b + Qwen3.5-397B "KL stuck at ~0.0027" failure.

    The install-once-mutate-state pattern works even post-compile because
    the hook closure references ``worker._abliterix_plan`` by identity,
    not value — updating the dict per trial propagates to whatever layer
    the hook eventually fires on. Combined with ``enforce_eager=True``
    (also required — see ``vllm_cudagraph_hook_weight_invisible`` memo),
    this reliably steers per-trial without re-registration.

    The hook subtracts a per-expert penalty from the router logits:
    ``logits[..., eid] -= penalty``. A penalty of ~20 typically suffices
    to push an expert out of top-4 on BF16 routers; 50+ for FP8 routers.
    The penalty is computed from a scale in ``[0, 1]`` via
    ``-log(max(scale, 1e-6)) * 10`` so ``scale=1`` is a no-op and
    ``scale=0`` completely excludes the expert.

    Idempotent: repeated calls return the existing install's hook count
    without re-registering.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Expert-Granular Abliteration (EGA) on vLLM — in-place orthogonal projection
# of the refusal direction from every expert's fused down_proj (w2_weight).
#
# Unlike router suppression (which edits the small replicated router gate),
# EGA edits the large fused expert tensor. Under vLLM TP this tensor is
# SHARDED along the intermediate dim, so every worker holds a slice
# (num_experts, hidden, intermediate/TP). The steering vector lives in the
# `hidden` dim which stays intact across ranks — each worker applies the
# projection locally with zero cross-rank sync required.
#
# Why this works under CUDA graphs (verified in vllm_backend.py already):
#   * tensor .data.copy_(new_values) preserves the storage pointer → CUDA
#     graphs captured before the edit continue to read the new values.
#   * UnquantizedFusedMoEMethod's forward reads `layer.w2_weight` per call
#     (unquantized_fused_moe_method.py:281), not a cached pointer.
#   * For TRITON backend `process_weights_after_loading` is effectively
#     identity — no repack to invalidate.
#
# ONLY runs on TRITON / BATCHED_TRITON backend (BF16 unquantized MoE).
# For FLASHINFER_TRTLLM backend the kernel reads a repacked tensor;
# we detect that via a shape probe and abort with a clear error.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Attention weight editor (q/k/v/o_proj orthogonal projection under vLLM TP)
#
# vLLM FUSES q, k, v into a single ``QKVParallelLinear`` module holding one
# weight tensor shaped ``(q_size + 2 * kv_size, hidden)`` per rank, with
# layout ``[Q; K; V]`` along dim 0. abliteration wants SEPARATE steering
# strengths per component (sp.q_proj / sp.k_proj / sp.v_proj). We slice
# the fused weight, project each slice independently, and write back —
# which keeps kernel contracts intact since layout is preserved.
#
# ``o_proj`` is a ``RowParallelLinear`` with weight ``(hidden, total_head
# _dim / TP)`` — input sharded, output intact. The steering vector lives
# in hidden (the OUTPUT axis of o_proj) so projection stays local per rank.
#
# TP sharding summary — NO cross-rank sync required:
#   * qkv_proj: input (hidden) intact across ranks → projection on input
#     axis works locally. Row-norm preservation uses local row norms.
#   * o_proj: output (hidden) intact → projection on output axis works
#     locally. Row-norm preservation also local.
